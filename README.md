A Python app that fetches turn data from Neptunes Pride (np.ironhelmet.com) and, if there is a new turn, sends a message to your Discord channel to notify players.

App is workable but needs a bit of setting up. 

This was a quick project and the first solo project coming out of Codeclans software development course. It requires a bit of refactoring and a general clean up to make DRY.
